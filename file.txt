Generate a PlantUML diagram for the method `methodName` in the following format:
- The diagram should show the main method, its logic, and any methods it calls.
- Include any subsequent methods called by the initial method and their interactions.
- Represent loops, conditions, and decision points in the logic clearly.
- Use `alt`, `loop`, and `opt` constructs in PlantUML where applicable for conditions, loops, and optional flows.

For example:
- If the method contains a conditional `if-else`, represent it using `alt`.
- If the method calls another method multiple times in a loop, represent it using `loop`.
- Represent external service calls or API calls as external components.

Input Code Example:
```java
public void exampleMethod() {
    if (condition1) {
        methodA();
    } else {
        methodB();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        methodC();
    }
    externalService.callService();
}
